# An Empirical Study on GitHub Repositories - Exploring the Types of Repositories

## Introduction

*NOTE: Following excert is from the final project report.*

GitHub  is the largest and most advanced development platform in the world. Millions of developers and companies build, ship and maintain their software on GitHub. According to the company, it contains over 200 million repositories with over 65 million developers utilizing the platform, making it the largest source code host as of April 2020 [10]. As a result, it lends itself to data mining applications for several research studies, leveraging the invaluable open-source projects available in the websiteâ€™s massive database.
Being home to a large chunk of code hosted online does not take away from the fact that it is incredibly diverse. Hence, the goal of this study was to take a deep dive into all the source code available on GitHub in order to infer trends. This shall help quell the curiosity surrounding the proportions of various types of software and the type that enjoys the most support for open-source contributions. In addition, this would enable and act as a catalyst for future studies regarding software data collection in general.

## Repository Structure
- The code is in the `gitHubAPI.py` file. You will need to create a .env file with your `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` value.

- The Docs folder contains the final project report along with additional insights obtained during the course of this study.
